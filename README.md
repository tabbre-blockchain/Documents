# **Introduction**

Tabbre’s mission is to harness the power of crypto scarcity to accelerate the global transition to a green decentralised prosperous and secure future. 
To this end, Tabbre has devised two hugely important decentralised ledger innovations. The first, to be implemented by the **Tabb Project**, is a change to the way the proof of work protocol works, this change is called the “Dual Coinbase Model” and it will allow the harnessing of blockchain and cryptocurrency mania to fund the transitioning of the world from fossil fuels to sustainable energy and the second, to be implemented by the **Bre Project**, is a new consensus protocol called “proof of majority” that will allow the creation of a massively scalable decentralised financial and smart contract ledger that will enable the transition to a universal decentralised financial system.
The two projects are collectively called the Tabbre Scheme. The Tabb project comes first and its success will create the conditions needed for the success of the Bre project.

# **The Tabb Project**

In proof of work (PoW) blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, the miner who wins the race to create the next block for the blockchain gets to pay themselves a number of coins, called the block reward, this is currently 6.25 Bitcoin (about US$ 300,000) for Bitcoin miners. The block reward is the first transaction in the mined block and is paid to the coinbase account, an account to which the miner owns the private key.

**Tabbre’s first innovation is this: to create a new PoW blockchain, the Tabb Chain, where instead of the block reward being paid out to a single coinbase account it shall be paid into two coinbase accounts, one for the block’s miner and a second specified and controlled by a Decentralised Foundation (DF). The Decentralised Foundation will be charged with using the block rewards to achieve a Good Purpose (GP). This is called the Dual Coinbase Model (DCM)**.

Typically, for investment purposes, crypto assets are not sold but used as collateral against which fiat currency can be borrowed. This is because crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Ether have, relative to fiat currency, appreciated enormously over the years, a trend which is expected to continue. In the case of Bitcoin this appreciation is about one hundred million percent over ten years.
The Decentralised Foundation would be expected to use its reserves as collateral for borrowing fiat denominated capital that would then be invested in economically viable schemes that support the achievement of the Good Purpose.
Profits from the investments would be reinvested up to a predetermined point, the Distribution Point (DP), after which profits will be distributed to coin holders. It is expected that distributions will take the form of a coin buy back and burn, with the Foundation using funds allocated for distribution to purchase coins in the open market and burning them. It would also burn an equal number of its own coins to maintain symmetry and trust. These buybacks will have the effect of increasing the value of the remaining coins by creating an extra demand for them while simultaneously reducing their supply. 
If Bitcoin had been configured in this way when it was launched, with the Bitcoin’s Decentralised Foundation’s Good Purpose being simply to invest in US S&P 500 index stocks, the Bitcoin Decentralised Foundation would be sitting on over 2 trillion dollars in stocks and could this year cover the cost of its fiat currency borrowings and provide a capital growth of 10% and distribute 100 billion dollars to Bitcoin holders by buying and burning Bitcoins, this represents $300,000 for every newly mined Bitcoin, thus driving the price of Bitcoin higher.A Decentralised Foundation (DF), The Tabbre Foundation, is required for this type of scheme to work, and is a legal person, such as an England and Wales not for profit company, that is bound by its articles of association to enact the will of the blockchain’s coin holders. 
Achieving this requires a smart contract execution environment to be provided by the blockchain so that the smart contracts that encode the DF’s governance and tokenocracy rules can be processed.

**The Tabbre project will use the Dual Coinbase Model to help fund the transition to a global low carbon sustainable energy economy.**

To achieve this, the Tabbre Decentralised Foundation’s Good Purpose will be:The development of commercially viable Sustainable Energy generation and distribution and storage capacity. The distribution point will be no earlier than 10 years from the scheme's commencement date and linked to an objective, such as, delivering more than 120 Exajoules of energy per year.

The Tabb blockchain, the “Tabb Chain” expresses a digital gold like currency called the Tabb with a limited supply (c. 1.2 billion) and periodic block reward halving every two years and a point at which no new Tabb will be created. This is like Bitcoin and requires a fully decentralised proof of work blockchain to express it: the Tabb Chain.

# **The Bre Project**

The Bre Project will implement the Bre currency and its native blockchain ledger, a proof of stake blockchain, the Bre Chain and also the proof of majority (PoM) transaction ledger, the Tabbre Ledger.
Bre will be the currency for the pricing and sale of electricity generated by the Tabb scheme. This role will create a substantial and sustainable global economic role for Bre allowing it to become an international decentralised currency to rival fiat currencies.

As such Bre will need to be created in sufficient quantities that it operates as a stable value coin. It is envisaged the value of Bre will be governed by the average price of energy produced by the scheme, for example, 1 Bre will be the average cost of 100 Kwh/360 MJ of energy supplied by the scheme. The transactional volume that Bre will need to handle will be massive, so it is proposed that there will be two mechanisms for handling Bre. 

The first will be the Bre Chain, this will be a block chain based on the Ouroboros proof of stake consensus algorithm that will use Tabb for staking and will price transaction charges in Bre. The Bre Chain will create new Bre. Bre creation will be governed by configurable smart contract based rules.

The Tabbre Ledger, will be a massively scalable ledger that uses the Tabbre Projects second key innovation, the proof of majority (PoM) public consensus protocol. The Tabbre Ledger can scale linearly to process millions of transactions per second including both value transfer transactions and smart contract transactions. The Tabbre Ledger will integrate seamlessly with both the Tabb Chain and Bre Chain.

# **The Tabbre Global Ledger Project**

The attached picture of the Tabbre scheme shows how the various elements of the Tabbre scheme interact.
The reason that this scheme has three decentralised ledgers is that each one has a different purpose that the others cannot perform. 
The Tabb chain expresses a digital gold that requires the Tabb Chain to be a fully decentralised proof of work blockchain and as such the Tabb Chain will not be able to process large numbers of transactions and will also have a relatively long transaction confirmation time. It will also charge for transactions in Tabb.
Bre needs a reliable and trustworthy blockchain that can process smart contracts as well as create new Bre. This requirement is delivered by the proof of stake Bre Chain. The Bre Chain however will be able to process only a few tens of transactions per second.
For Bre to be usable as a worldwide alternative to fiat currencies it will need a transaction processing rate equivalent to the existing electronic currency systems. This implies a rate of millions of transactions per second with a subsecond transaction confirmation time. The Tabbre proof of majority ledger can deliver this capability.

# **Introduction** {#introduction}

## **Tabbre Project Overview**

The Tabbre Project mission is to solve the climate crisis and help end global poverty by harnessing the power of blockchain and crypto scarcity to fund the development of cheap and plentiful sustainable renewable energy at a global scale. 

At the moment, sustainable renewable energy is very expensive when compared to fossil fuel derived energy. This is because the scale of infrastructure that is needed to capture enough sunlight and wind energy to cope with intermittency and seasonality is enormous and hence very expensive. This is slowing the transition from fossil fuels. If we are to achieve a sustainable and prosperous future we need renewable energy to provide a cheaper alternative to fossil fuels.

The Tabbre Project is at the forefront of a major transformation, leveraging blockchain technology and crypto scarcity to fund the global development of sustainable energy. 

The project aims to address a significant portion of the world’s energy needs by constructing vast oceanic solar farms in the largely uninhabited oceanic gyres of the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and South Indian Oceans. 

These solar farms, composed of lightweight, recyclable plastic structures, will be fully automated and managed by AI, ensuring that no new materials are required once established, as all components will be recycled in autonomous facilities.

## **Energy Production and Utilisation**

The electricity generated from these solar farms will be used to electrolyze water, producing hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen will then be converted into methane and ammonia, which can be stored and shipped as clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels. 

By solving the renewable energy intermittency problem with easily storable chemical fuels, Tabbre will provide a more abundant, sustainable energy source that is cheaper than fossil fuels. This economic advantage will drive the global transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy, making it a practical and attractive choice for consumers.

## **Economic, Environmental & Social Impact**

Tabbre's sustainable energy approach is designed to be both economically beneficial and environmentally responsible. The project’s profits will be reinvested into expanding renewable energy capacity until a target output is achieved. At that point, profits will be distributed through the purchase and burning of TABB tokens, aiming to increase their value. Additionally, a significant portion of the profits will fund a global universal basic income (GUBI), which will be distributed in BRE, Tabbre’s stable value cryptocurrency.

## **Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Integration**

The Tabbre ecosystem will introduce two new cryptocurrencies: TABB and BRE. TABB will be mined on the TabbreChain blockchain, a proof of stake blockchain with a fixed supply and block rewards that halve every year. A decentralized foundation will hold half of the mined TABB to collateralize debt financing for the solar farms' development. BRE will be used to price and trade the energy produced by Tabbre, as well as to pay the UBI. With project growth, BRE aims to become a decentralized global reserve currency.

## **Project Goals**

The Tabbre Project seeks to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy while establishing a decentralized global financial system. By making renewable energy more affordable and accessible, the project aims to mitigate the climate crisis and alleviate global poverty.

# **Energy** {#energy}

The Tabbre Project is designed to revolutionise energy production by utilising vast, floating solar farms in the world’s oceanic gyres. These solar farms are strategically placed in the largely uninhabited and ecologically sparse regions of the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and South Indian Oceans. This innovative approach not only maximises the production of renewable energy but also addresses many of the challenges associated with traditional energy production and distribution.

## **Oceanic Solar Farms**

**Oceanic Gyres:** The Tabbre Project takes advantage of the areas of water within oceanic gyres — large, circular ocean currents found in the Earth's major oceans. These areas are ideal for deploying floating solar farms because they are remote, largely uninhabited, and devoid of significant marine life. The gyres are situated far from land, where minimal sand and dust are blown into the water, resulting in low levels of iron. This lack of iron means that these waters support little to no plant or animal life, making them ideal for large scale industrial activity without environmental disruption.

![Oceanic Gyres](https://github.com/tabbre-blockchain/Documents/blob/master/images/GyresMap.png?raw=true)

**Floating Solar Farms:** Constructed using lightweight, flexible, and recyclable plastic materials, these structures are designed to be durable and capable of withstanding the harsh marine environment. Their flexibility allows the solar panels to conform to the movements of the ocean, reducing the risk of damage from waves and storms.

**Scale and Capacity:** Each solar farm spans thousands of square kilometres, with multiple farms planned to cover millions of square kilometres across the gyres. The scale of these farms allows for the production of vast amounts of electricity, far exceeding what can be produced by traditional land-based solar farms.

**Automation and AI Management:** The entire infrastructure of the solar farms is fully automated, with AI and robotic systems managing the installation, operation, maintenance, and recycling processes. This automation minimises the need for human intervention, reduces labour costs, and enhances efficiency. AI systems monitor the performance of each solar panel, optimise energy output, and manage the recycling of materials at the end of their lifecycle.

## **Electricity Generation and Conversion**

**Photovoltaic Solar Panels:** The primary method of electricity generation in the Tabbre Project is through photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity. Given the location of the farms in tropical waters, where sunlight is abundant year round, the solar panels operate at high efficiency, generating a reliable supply of electricity.

The key enabling technology for Tabbre’s floating solar farms are perovskite based photovoltaic materials, that allow the creation of  very efficient, light, flexible, cheap and durable plastic perovskites solar panels that are much cheaper than silicon.

**Electrolysis of Water:** The electricity generated by the solar panels is used to electrolyze seawater, splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen. This process is central to the Tabbre Project’s strategy, as it allows for the conversion of solar energy into a form that can be easily stored and transported.

**Hydrogen Production:** The electrolysis process produces hydrogen gas, which is then captured and stored in specialised containers on the floating platforms. Hydrogen serves as a versatile energy carrier, capable of being used directly as a fuel or converted into other chemical fuels.

**Oxygen Venting:** The oxygen produced during electrolysis is typically vented back into the atmosphere, as it is not needed for the subsequent energy storage and conversion processes. This venting has no negative environmental impact, as the oxygen simply mixes with the natural atmospheric composition.

## **Conversion to Chemical Fuels**

**Hydrogen to Methane and Ammonia:** To solve the problem of energy storage and transportation, the Tabbre Project converts the hydrogen produced via electrolysis into two main chemical fuels: **methane** and **ammonia**. These fuels are chosen for their energy density, ease of storage, and versatility as replacements for fossil fuels.

**Methane Production:** Hydrogen is combined with carbon dioxide (CO2) captured from the atmosphere to produce methane (CH4) using the Sabatier reaction process. Methane is a highly efficient energy carrier that can be liquefied for storage and transport. It serves as a direct replacement for natural gas, which is widely used for heating, electricity generation, and as a feedstock in industrial processes.

**Ammonia Production:** Hydrogen is also combined with nitrogen (N2) from the atmosphere to produce ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is a carbon free fuel that can be used in a variety of applications, including power generation, transportation, and in the production of fertilisers. Its ability to be easily liquefied and stored makes it an ideal fuel for long distance transport and as a stable energy reserve.

**Energy Storage and Transportation:** The chemical fuels produced (methane and ammonia) are liquefied, stored on-site in specialised storage tanks and transported by tankers to global markets. The ability to convert solar energy into storable, transportable chemical fuels addresses one of the major challenges of renewable energy: intermittency. Unlike electricity, which must be used as it is generated or stored in expensive and inefficient batteries, chemical fuels can be stored indefinitely and transported over long distances, ensuring a reliable energy supply.

## **Environmental and Economic Benefits**

**Environmental Impact:**  The production of methane and ammonia through the Tabbre Project is environmentally friendly. The hydrogen is derived from water, and the carbon dioxide used in methane production is captured directly from the atmosphere, creating a closed loop system that does not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the use of oceanic gyres, which are naturally devoid of life, ensures that the large scale industrial activities do not harm marine ecosystems.

**Economic Viability:**  The Tabbre Project’s approach to energy production is not only sustainable but also economically advantageous. By leveraging the vast and untapped solar energy potential of the oceanic gyres, the project can produce energy at a fraction of the cost of traditional fossil fuels. This economic efficiency is expected to drive widespread adoption of the project’s energy solutions, making the transition from fossil fuels to sustainable energy not just possible, but inevitable.

**Market Forces and Adoption:**  The combination of low production costs and the scalability of the Tabbre Project’s technology will make its energy products highly competitive in global markets. As these products become cheaper than fossil fuels, market forces will naturally drive the transition to sustainable energy, reducing the need for government interventions or subsidies.

**Global Impact:** The widespread adoption of Tabbre’s energy solutions will contribute significantly to reducing global carbon emissions, helping to mitigate climate change. Furthermore, the production of affordable, sustainable energy will provide economic benefits to developing countries, enabling them to transition away from fossil fuels and achieve energy independence.

## **Future Expansion and Innovation**

**Scaling the Model:** The Tabbre Project’s focus is on the oceanic gyres, these provide enough space to easily accommodate solar farms that satisfy any conceivable future demand for energy. As technology advances, the efficiency and capacity of the solar farms will improve, allowing for even greater energy production. Future innovations in materials science, AI, and robotics will further enhance the project’s scalability and economic viability.

**Research and Development:** Ongoing research and development efforts will focus on improving the efficiency of solar panels, electrolysis processes, and the conversion of hydrogen into chemical fuels. Tabbre also plans to explore additional applications for the fuels produced, such as in emerging industries like hydrogen fuel cells and synthetic fertilisers. 

# **The Economic Model** {#the-economic-model}

The world needs about 15 terawatts of solar capacity to properly replace the energy derived from fossil fuels. This will require a solar PV collector area of between 850,000 km2 and 1,200,000 km2. This averages to about 70,000,000 square metres per gigawatt of capacity. Tabbre will ramp up production using the knowledge gained from an incremental deployment of ever greater capacity. Allowing a multi-terawatt capability to be constructed by the early 2040’s.

The strategy that Tabbre will follow for achieving this include both the extensive use of AI enabled robotic automations and reducing the per unit of capacity capital cost by vertical integration of its supply chain and fully automating equipment production, facility deployment and operational processes. Vertical integration is important because it lowers cost, improves efficiency, locks in Tabbre’s competitive advantages and improves the pace of innovation.

The full system cost of floating solar farms, and harvesters, factory ships and product transport ships is expected to start at USD 50 per square metre for early small scale facilities and then to quickly drop to around USD 5 per square metre for full scale production. A gigawatt facility will therefore have a capital cost of USD 3.5 billion for an early stage facility. This figure drops to USD 350 million per gigawatt once the technology achieves maturity, which is planned to be in time for the transition to multi gigawatt capacity. 

This implies a capital requirement of c. USD 5.25 trillion to provide 15 Terawatts of capacity required to replace today’s oil, coal and natural gas. To provide a context for this figure, the current annual global investment into new fossil fuel projects is running at over USD 2 trillion. Amortising over 10 years, gives Tabbre  an annual capex of $525 billion. Tabbre’s energy will be much cheaper than fossil fuels.

The Tabbre Project will fund this capital requirement using a mixture of debt and retained earnings from the sale of energy. Modelling suggests that the scheme will be largely debt free by the time it’s scaling to multi-terawatt capacity.

Assuming that the scheme charges USD 35 per megawatt hour of delivered energy. Each gigawatt installation will have a revenue of c. USD 223 million per year giving an expected revenue of USD 3.3 trillion for a 15 terawatt capacity scheme.

It is expected that the replacement cost of rafts and harvesters will plunge to zero as a result of the automation of the recycling and production facilities. This implies that once the Tabbre scheme is deployed it will have very few input costs, no land is used, the solar farms are located in unused international waters, no capital is required since the scheme will be able to pay back any borrowings needed and much of the expansion will be largely self financed by the reinvestment of profits into solar farms, harvesters, factory ships and transport ships. Very little labour is needed because of AI and robotic automation.

## **The Tabbre Model**

![The Tabbre Scheme](https://github.com/tabbre-blockchain/Documents/blob/master/images/Tabbre%20Scheme.png?raw=true)

# **Economic Impact** {#economic-impact}

The Tabbre Project is poised to have significant economic and environmental effects, reshaping global energy markets and contributing to the fight against climate change. The project’s innovative approach to renewable energy production and distribution not only offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels but also provides a model for economic development that aligns with environmental stewardship.

## **Reduction in Energy Costs**

**Cost Efficiency of Floating Solar Farms**: Tabbre floating solar farms are designed to be much cheaper to construct and operate compared to traditional land based solar farms. By using lightweight, recyclable plastics and fully automated systems, the project minimises capital and operational expenditures. These cost savings are passed on to consumers, making Tabbre’s energy significantly cheaper than fossil fuels.

**Market Competitiveness**: Tabbre’s renewable energy low production costs allow effective competition in the global energy market. As Tabbre’s energy becomes the most cost effective option, market forces will shift demand from fossil fuels to renewable energy. This transition is expected to be accelerated by the economic benefits offered by Tabbre’s energy solutions, particularly in regions where energy affordability is a critical concern.

## **Global Economic Growth**

**Stimulating Economic Developmen**t: By providing affordable and abundant energy, the Tabbre Project can stimulate economic growth, particularly in developing regions where energy access has been limited. Cheaper energy reduces the cost of production across industries, enabling businesses to expand and creating new opportunities for economic development. This can lead to job creation, improved standards of living, and greater economic stability in emerging markets.

**Investment Opportunities**: The Tabbre Project presents significant investment opportunities through its TABB cryptocurrency. As a governance and investment token, TABB allows investors to participate in the profits generated by the project. The expected appreciation in the value of TABB, driven by the buy back and burn strategy, makes it an attractive asset for both individual and institutional investors. This influx of investment capital will further fuel the growth and expansion of the Tabbre Project.

**Global Universal Basic Income (GUBI):** An innovative economic aspect of the Project is its commitment to funding a global universal basic income (UBI). A portion of the profits from the sale of energy will be allocated to this UBI, which will be distributed in BRE, the project’s stable value cryptocurrency. This UBI has the potential to reduce global poverty by providing a basic income to people worldwide, regardless of their location or economic status.

**Economic Stabilisation**: The UBI funded by Tabbre’s profits can act as a stabilising force in the global economy. Its reliable income stream can assist reduce economic inequality, increase consumer spending and enhance social stability. This, in turn, can lead to more resilient economies, particularly in regions that are vulnerable to economic shocks.

## **Creation of a Decentralized Global Financial System**

**BRE as a Global Reserve Currency**: BRE, the utility cryptocurrency of the Tabbre ecosystem, is designed to become a decentralized global reserve currency. As BRE is used for both energy transactions and UBI payments, its adoption will increase globally. The stability of BRE, backed by the value of energy, provides a reliable alternative to traditional fiat currencies, especially in regions with unstable or inflation prone economies.

**Decentralized Financial Inclusion**: The decentralized nature of the Tabbre financial system allows for greater financial inclusion. Individuals and businesses in regions with limited access to traditional banking services can participate in the global economy through the use of TABB and BRE. This inclusion promotes economic equality and empowers individuals in economically disadvantaged areas.

# **Environmental Impact** {#environmental-impact}

## **Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions**

* **Replacing Fossil Fuels with Clean Energy:** The Tabbre Project’s production of clean chemical fuels, such as methane and ammonia, directly replaces the need for fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. By providing a viable and cost effective alternative, Tabbre will significantly reduce the global reliance on fossil fuels, leading to a substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. This reduction is critical in the fight against climate change and the efforts to meet global carbon reduction targets.

* **Carbon Neutrality:** The process of producing methane in the Tabbre Project involves capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which offsets the carbon emissions when the methane is eventually used as fuel. This closed loop system ensures that the overall carbon footprint of the energy produced is minimised, contributing to global carbon neutrality goals.

## **Minimal Environmental Disruption**

* **Use of Sterile Oceanic Gyres:** The Tabbre Project’s floating solar farms are located in oceanic gyres, which are large, mostly sterile regions of the ocean that are far from land and devoid of significant marine life. By placing the solar farms in these areas, the project avoids disrupting natural ecosystems, as these regions lack the biodiversity found in other parts of the ocean. This strategic location minimises the environmental impact of the solar farms and ensures that marine life and ecosystems remain unaffected.

* **Recyclable and Sustainable Materials:** The solar farms are constructed using materials that are not only durable but also fully recyclable. At the end of their lifecycle, all components of the solar farms will be recycled in fully automated facilities. This commitment to recycling and sustainability reduces the need for new raw materials, decreases waste, and minimises the project’s overall environmental footprint.

## **Long-Term Environmental Benefits**

* **Supporting Global Climate Goals:** The Tabbre Project aligns with global climate goals, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement, by providing a scalable solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By making renewable energy more affordable and accessible, Tabbre accelerates the global transition to a low carbon economy, helping to keep global temperature rise well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

* **Incentivizing Environmental Responsibility:** The project’s economic model, which ties the value of its cryptocurrencies to sustainable energy production, creates a financial incentive for environmental responsibility. As more individuals and businesses adopt Tabbre’s energy solutions, the demand for sustainable practices will increase, encouraging further innovation and investment in green technologies.

## **Preservation of Natural Resources**

* **Reducing Dependence on Non Renewable Resources:** By providing a renewable source of energy, Tabbre reduces the global dependence on non renewable resources. This not only helps to conserve these finite resources for future generations but also reduces the environmental degradation associated with their extraction, processing, and use.

* **Promoting Circular Economy Practices:** The Tabbre Project’s commitment to recycling and the use of sustainable materials supports the principles of a circular economy, where resources are reused and recycled rather than discarded. This approach reduces waste, conserves natural resources, and minimises the environmental impact of energy production.

# **Cryptocurrency & Blockchain**  {#cryptocurrency-&-blockchain}

The Tabbre Project's integration of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is central to its innovative approach to funding, managing, and expanding its sustainable energy initiatives. This integration is structured around two primary digital currencies, TABB and BRE. These are both expressed on the TabbreChain, a dedicated proof of stake (PoS) blockchain.

## **TABB Cryptocurrency**

**Governance and Investment Token:** TABB serves as the governance and investment token within the Tabbre ecosystem. TABB’s role is pivotal in the operational management of the Project and as a vehicle for investment.

* **Decentralized Governance:** TABB holders have voting rights within the Tabbre DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This means they can participate in important decisions regarding the project’s development, such as changes to protocols, strategic direction, and financial management. This decentralized governance structure ensures that the project remains community driven and that decisions reflect the collective interest of TABB holders.

**Proof of Stake Blockchain:** The TabbreChain’s proof of stake consensus mechanism is more energy efficient than proof of work. Validators on the TabbreChain secure the network by staking their TABB tokens, which means they lock up a certain amount of tokens to participate in the validation of transactions. This process not only secures the network but also incentivizes validators through the earning of rewards, which helps maintain the stability and integrity of the blockchain.

* **Fixed Supply and Halving Schedule:** TABB has a fixed maximum supply, which creates scarcity — a key factor in its value proposition. The TabbreChain is programmed to reduce the block rewards at predetermined block heights, approximately every year. This halving process slows the issuance of new TABB tokens, increasing their scarcity and potentially driving up their value over time.

**Collateralization and Financial Returns**

* **The Tabbre Foundation:** The Tabbre Foundation holds half of all minted TABB tokens. These tokens are used as collateral for debt financing, which is essential for funding the construction and expansion of the Tabbre Project’s oceanic solar farms. By leveraging TABB as collateral, the project can secure necessary capital without diluting the value of existing tokens or incurring high interest debt.

* **Buy Back and Burn Mechanism:** A portion of the profits generated from the Tabbre Project’s energy sales will be used to repurchase TABB tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be “burned” or permanently removed from circulation. This buy back and burn strategy reduces the total supply of TABB, increasing its scarcity and supporting its long term value appreciation.

## **BRE Cryptocurrency**

**Utility and Stable Value Coin:** BRE is the utility token within the Tabbre ecosystem, primarily used for transactions related to the purchase and sale of energy produced by the Tabbre Project. BRE operates on the **TabbreChain**, a proof of stake (PoS) blockchain that is designed for efficiency and scalability.

**Algorithmic Stability/ Stable Value Mechanism:** BRE is designed as an algorithmic stablecoin, so that its value is kept stable through a combination of smart contracts, algorithmic adjustments, and market mechanisms. The value of BRE is pegged to the energy produced by the Tabbre Project, giving it a tangible asset base. This stability is crucial for BRE’s role as a medium of exchange within the ecosystem, ensuring that its purchasing power remains consistent.

* **Supply and Demand Management:** The Tabbre DAO uses smart contracts to manage the supply of BRE in response to market conditions. If the value of BRE begins to rise or fall beyond a certain range, the DAO can issue or buy back BRE tokens to stabilise its value. This process is transparent and governed by pre-set rules that are publicly available, ensuring that the system operates predictably and fairly.

* **BRE issued as credit:** Once the Tabbre scheme reaches maturity, all BRE will be issued as credit. The Tabbre Foundation will lend newly created BRE to collateralized autonomous lending agents (ALA). The interest rate charged will be equivalent to a fiat currency central bank interest rate. The  ALA’s will then lend BRE to their customers at a commercial interest rate. With BRE existing as credit this ensures BRE maintains its value.

## **Role in Global Transactions**

* **Energy Transactions:** All energy produced by the Tabbre Project is priced and sold in BRE. This creates a constant demand for BRE, as consumers and businesses need to acquire it to purchase energy. By tying the currency directly to energy production, the project ensures that BRE’s value is underpinned by a tangible, essential commodity.

* **Universal Basic Income (UBI):** BRE is also used to distribute a global universal basic income (UBI) funded by the Tabbre Project’s profits. This UBI helps to redistribute wealth and provide economic stability, particularly in regions where traditional financial systems are weak or inaccessible. The use of BRE for UBI payments further broadens its adoption and solidifies its role as a global currency.

## **Potential as a Global Reserve Currency**

* **Decentralized Global Reserve Currency:** With its stable value and wide use in global energy transactions, BRE has the potential to evolve into a decentralized global reserve currency. Unlike traditional fiat currencies that are tied to specific national economies, BRE is backed by the global production and consumption of energy, making it less susceptible to national economic policies and geopolitical risks.

* **Financial Inclusion:** BRE’s role in the Tabbre ecosystem promotes financial inclusion by providing a stable, accessible currency that can be used by anyone with access to the internet. This is particularly important in regions where access to traditional banking is limited. BRE allows individuals and businesses in these areas to participate in the global economy, facilitating trade, investment, and economic development.

## **Integrated Smart Contracts**

**Smart Contract Automation:** The integration of smart contracts within the TabbreChain allows for the automation of various functions, such as token issuance, supply adjustments, and governance decisions. These smart contracts are pre-programmed with rules that automatically execute when certain conditions are met, reducing the need for manual intervention and ensuring that the system operates efficiently and transparently.

**Transparency and Trust:** All transactions and operations within the Tabbre ecosystem are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable ledger. This transparency builds trust among users, as they can verify transactions, track the supply of tokens, and monitor the implementation of governance decisions in real-time.

## **Security and Sustainability**

**Blockchain & Network Security:** The TabbreChain employs robust security protocols to protect against attacks and ensure the integrity of the network. The proof of stake (PoS)  system has  security mechanisms, tailored to their respective consensus algorithms.

* **Decentralization and Resilience:** The decentralized nature of the ecosystem ensures that no single entity controls the network. This enhances security by making it difficult for any one actor to compromise the system. Additionally, the use of distributed nodes around the world ensures that the network remains resilient, even in the face of localised disruptions.

* **Energy Efficiency of TabbreChain:** The TabbreChain’s PoS consensus is inherently more energy efficient than proof of work, aligning with the Tabbre Project’s commitment to sustainability. By reducing the energy consumption required for securing the blockchain, the project minimises its environmental footprint, furthering its role as sustainable practice leader..

* **Long-Term Sustainability:** The Tabbre Project is designed with long-term sustainability in mind. From the recyclable materials used in its solar farms to the energy efficient operation of its blockchain systems, every aspect of the project is geared towards reducing environmental impact while maximising economic benefits. TABB and BRE within this framework, ensure that the financial system supporting the project is as sustainable as the energy it produces.

## **Future Innovations and Scalability**

* **Ongoing Research and Development:** The Tabbre Project is committed to continuous innovation. The development teams are constantly exploring new technologies and methodologies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the TABB and BRE blockchains. This includes advancements in smart contract technology, improvements in blockchain scalability, and the exploration of new use cases for TABB and BRE.

* **Expansion of the Ecosystem:** As the Tabbre Project grows, there will be opportunities to expand the ecosystem to include additional services and applications. This could involve the integration of other blockchain networks, partnerships with external organizations, and the development of new financial instruments that leverage TABB and BRE.

## **Scalability and Global Adoption:**

**Scaling Blockchain Infrastructure:** Both the TABB and BRE blockchains are designed to scale as demand increases. This scalability is crucial for supporting the growing number of users, transactions, and smart contracts within the ecosystem. By implementing advanced blockchain technologies, such as sharding and layer-2 solutions, the Tabbre Project ensures that its blockchain infrastructure can handle large volumes of data and transactions without compromising performance.

**Global Reach and Adoption:** The ultimate goal of the Tabbre Project is to achieve global adoption of its cryptocurrencies. By providing a stable, efficient, and transparent financial system, the project aims to attract users from all corners of the world, regardless of their location or economic status. This global reach is supported by the decentralized nature of the project, which allows anyone with internet access to participate in the ecosystem.

# **Conclusion** {#conclusion}

Tabbre has the potential to transform the course of history. Tabbre’s floating solar farms and associated methane and ammonia production facilities will provide an unlimited supply of cheap, carbon neutral fully sustainable energy for all of humanity's foreseeable needs. 

Tabbre by using the power of blockchain and decentralized organizations will also transform the global financial system. By selling energy priced in BRE and paying its universal basic income in BRE, Tabbre’s BRE currency will become a globally significant alternative to the US dollar as a reserve currency. 

The profits generated from the sale of Tabbre’s energy will fund a global universal basic income. This will have a significant effect on income levels for the poorest people on earth, helping to end the scourge of global poverty and the environmental harm that poverty causes. 

The Tabbre Foundation that is governed by a DAO will become the global monetary authority for BRE, allowing for BRE policy to be calibrated to the benefit of all nations, unlike the US dollar that is managed, as the national currency of the USA,  for the benefit of the USA.

And the bottom line? This isn’t science fiction. Unlike other solutions such as grid scale storage of electricity or nuclear fusion, no new science or new technologies are needed. Every technology that Tabbre needs to deliver its vision exists and is working. Our challenge is to take existing technology and apply it at scale. We believe that  we have found a viable path to achieving this. Join us and help make this vision our reality.
